Expected Result: 

Notes: 
TODO: where do we talk about adding JavaScript/LESS files? There may need to be another guide 'Working with Piwik's UI'
TODO: also need to talk about special elements on the page and how to create your own widgets and how to use Piwik's JS code
TODO: mention JS libs used, talk about ajaxHelper & uicontrol base object & require

What's missing? (stuff in my list that was not in when I wrote the 1st draft)
