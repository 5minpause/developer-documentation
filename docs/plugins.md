# Implementing a plugin
## CLI tool
Piwik comes with a powerful command line tool to help you generating a plugin easily. The command line tool is called "console" and is located in the Piwik root directory.
To get familiar with the command line tool enter either `./console` or `php console`. As you haven't specified any command yet, it will list you all available commands along with their descriptions. 
The most interesting commands for developers are:

* `generate:plugin`
* `generate:theme`
* `generate:api`
* `generate:controller`
* `generate:visualizationplugin`
* `log:watch`
* `tests:run`

To execute a specific command just enter the name of the command as an argument:

`./console log:watch`

Some of the commands require further arguments or options. Use `help` to see which ones are available for a specific command:

`./console help generate:plugin`

Some of the arguments and options are required, whereas other are optional. If you do not specify a value, the command line tool will ask you to enter the missing values. So you do not have to care much about arguments and options. Easy!

### Creating a plugin
Execute the command `./console generate:plugin` in order to create a new plugin. The CLI tool will ask you to enter a name, a description and a version number. This creates a very basic plugin for you including all the necessary files. If you already know that you need a Controller and an API, the console tool can create those for you as well. 

## Building the plugin
### Namespaces
### Defining new widgets
### Defining new menus
### Using the database
#### Create a new table
#### Update schemaf
### Track additional data
### Understanding Hooks

#### Register an action for a given hook
If you want to listen to a specific event, and trigger your own function when this event is posted, you have to define a method `getListHooksRegistered()` in your plugin class, that will return an array containing pair of (hook name, method to call).

For example if you want to execute your function `AddCityInformation()` when a new visitor is recorded by Piwik (hook `Tracker.newVisitorInformation`), in your class `MyPlugin` you would define a method:

```
function getListHooksRegistered()
{
    return array( 'Tracker.newVisitorInformation' => 'AddCityInformation' );
}
```

The hook `Tracker.newVisitorInformation` has an argument: an array containing the visitorâ€™s information. You can add new elements to this array. Example:

```
function AddCityInformation( &$visitorInfo )
{
    // we modify the variable, adding the new city field
    $visitorInfo['city'] = 'Paris, France';
}
```

You can have a look at the [provider plugin](https://github.com/piwik/piwik/blob/master/plugins/Provider/Provider.php#L31) to see an example of a plugin registering actions for multiple hooks.

Piwik also provides a means of dynamic hook registration using `Piwik_AddAction($eventName, $callback)`.

#### Add a new hook
Plugins can themselves post new events, the same way Piwik posts events. A common example is custom page headers and footers (on a per plugin basis).

```
Piwik_PostEvent( $eventName,  [ $object , [ $info ]])
```

or in Twig templates:

```
{{ '{{ postEvent($eventName) }}' }}
```
By convention, the event name should be prefixed by the Plugin name.

### Understanding Archiving
### How to create an API

Start by using the CLI tool to create the needed files: `./console generate:api`. This script creates a file named `API.php` within your plugin.

Each public method within this class will be accessible over the API. Adding new actions is as easy as creating a new function, accepting any input parameter you need and returning any value.

#### Filename API.php, public/private
#### Getting data from another API
#### Returning data as an array or DataTable
#### Authenticate users
### How to create a Controller

Start by using the CLI tool to create the needed files: `./console generate:controller`. This script creates a file named `Controller.php` within your plugin. The Controller already comes with a default action and template which is located in the `templates` directory.

Each public method within the controller will be accessible over the Piwik UI.
