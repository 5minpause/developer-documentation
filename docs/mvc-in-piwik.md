# MVC (Model-View-Controller) in Piwik

<!-- Meta (to be deleted)
Purpose:
 - describe request -> FrontController -> Controller -> API + twig views -> output process
 - describe Twig templates + how to use

Audience: plugin developers or core developers that want to know more about controllers, API, Twig Views

Expected Result: developers that understand how requests are handled by Piwik, how to implement controller methods, API methods, twig views.

Notes: 

What's missing? (stuff in my list that was not in when I wrote the 1st draft)
  - user roles
  - using controllers (FrontController::dispatch/fetchDispatch). should be in reusing controller methods section.
  - how DataTables are processed when going through API\Request (not sure what should go here and not in Piwik's Web API docs)
  - posting notifications (should go in controller section under 'alternative ways to communicate w/ the user'?)
  - connection between reports & APIs

## HTTP Request Workflow (TODO: rename 'workflow'?)

Piwik's MVC (Model-View-Controller) implementation is the first bit of code that is executed when Piwik handles an HTTP request.

Every request that is sent to Piwik's reporting side (as opposed to Piwik's tracking side) is sent to the index.php file in Piwik's root directory. This file creates an instance of the [FrontController](#) and uses it to dispatch the current request.

[FrontController](#) looks for the **module** and **action** query parameters and invokes the controller method specified by **action** in the plugin specified by **module**. If no **action** is specified, Piwik sends the request to the controller's `index` method.

The controller method that is called has to do one thing, which is output something (via `echo`). As a plugin developer you can do this in any way you'd like, Piwik won't stop you, but the convention used by the rest of Piwik is to create a Piwik [View](#), query APIs to request any needed data and then render the view. For example:

    class Controller extends \Piwik\Plugin\Controller
    {
        public function index()
        {
            $view = new View("@MyPlugin\index.twig");
            $view->data = \Piwik\Plugins\MyPlugin\API::getInstance()->getData();
            echo $view->render();
        }
    }

If a plugin with the above code was enabled and loaded, the request **?module=MyPlugin&action=index** would invoke the `index()` method above. **?module=MyPlugin** would have the same effect.

Read on to learn more about the individual components in this workflow.

## Piwik APIs (Models)

Piwik APIs serve two purposes: they serve the data used in views and they [automatically expose plugin functionality through a web API](#).

In this guide, we discuss the first purpose.

### About API Classes

Plugins provide APIs by defining a class named API that derives from [Piwik\Plugins\API](#). Every public method that does not have the `@ignore` annotation is exposed as part of Piwik's [Reporting Web API](#).

All APIs are singletons. To access API methods programatically the [Singleton::getInstance](#) method must be called first:

    MyAPI::getInstance()->doSomething();

**API methods**

API methods can take any number of parameters. Since they can be called through HTTP, methods must assume that parameters will be passed as strings. This also means that method parameters can only be simple values, such as `string`s, `bool`s, `numeric`s, etc.

API methods can return only one of four types of data: either a simple value (`string`, `bool`, `numeric`, etc), a [DataTable](#) instance, a [DataTable\Map](#) instance or an array of any of these values. This is so Piwik will always be able to convert the result into the desired output format in the reporting API.

If an API method encounters an error, it should throw an exception. Piwik will be able to convert exceptions to the desired output format in the reporting API.

**API method security**

All API methods should check whether the current user is allowed to invoke the method. If the API method is read-only, this means checking that the user has view access to the resources the method returns. If the API method does something, this normally means checking that the user has admin access to the functionality (or alternatively checking that the user is the super user). For example,

    public function getAllForSite($idSite)
    {
        Piwik::checkUserHasViewAccess($idSite);

        return // ...
    }


Look at the `check...` methods in the [Piwik](#) class to see what types of checks can be made.

**Calling API methods**

API methods can be called in two ways. They can be called directly after getting the API singleton instance:

    MyAPI::getInstance()->doSomething(
        Common::getRequestVar('idSite'),
        Common::getRequestVar('date'),
        Common::getRequestVar('period')
    );

or they can be called using the [Piwik\API\Request](#) class:

    Request::processRequest("MyAPI.doSomething");

Note how in the second method, the [Common::getRequestVar](#) method (which safely retrieves query parameter values) does not have to be called. The [Piwik\API\Request](#) class will forward the current request parameters to the API method which makes using it the better choice in some situations.

## Piwik Views (Views)

Piwik Views are classes that implement [ViewInterface](#). The main view class [Piwik\View](#) will use a [Twig](#) template that is specified upon construction to generate output. There is also another class called [ViewDataTable](#) that is used specifically to visualize analytics data.

Using a view is straightforward. First, it is configured. The meaning of this is different based on the View type. For [Piwik\View](#) instances, it simply means setting properties, for example:

    $view = new View("@MyPlugin/myTemplate.twig");

    // set properties
    $view->property1 = 'property1';
    $view->property2 = 'here's another property';

For [ViewDataTable](#), [it's a bit more complicated](#).

Once a view is configured, it is rendered via the [ViewInterface::render](#) method:

    echo $view->render();

This is the same for all view types.

### Twig Templates

The preferred way to generate anything text-based (like HTML) using data is to define Twig templates and use [View](#). Plugin developers should not accomplish this task with new view types unless they need to output something that is not text-based (such as an image).

_If you do not know how to create Twig templates, learn how by [reading Twig's documentation](#)._

**Template storage and referencing**

Templates are stored in the **templates** subdirectory of a plugin's root directory. When you create a [View](#) instance you must tell it what template it should use using a string with the following format: `"@{PluginName}/{PluginFileName}". Piwik will look for a file named **{PluginFileName}** in the **{PluginName}** plugin's **templates** subdirectory.

TODO: describe template naming convention!

**Twig functions and filters**

The [View](#) class adds several filters and functions before rendering a template. It will also define properties that the template can use. To learn exactly what's defined, read the [View class docs](#).

## Piwik Controllers

Controllers are the objects in Piwik that output HTML. Every plugin that wants to output HTML should define its own Controller that extends [Piwik\Plugin\Controller](#).

Every public method in a controller is exposed and can be called through an HTTP request. **When creating your controller, care should be taken to avoid exposing methods that don't need to be. It may be possible for an attacker to use these methods.**

### Controller Output

Controller methods should `echo` their output instead of `return`ing it. Piwik will assume the output is HTML and will automatically take care of the appropriate HTTP response headers. If you want to output something other than HTML you will have to output the **Content-Type** HTTP response header. For example:

    @header('Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8');

### Using Controller Methods in the Piwik UI

Adding a controller method to a plugin's controller will allow it to be executed via an HTTP request, but it won't automatically show it in the Piwik UI somewhere. There are two ways to make the result of a controller method appear in the Piwik UI:

* add a new menu item that links to the controller method
* use AJAX to invoke the controller method and then display the result

Here's how you do both:

**Adding controller methods as menu items**

Menu items are added through an event. Each menu has its own event:

* [Menu.Admin.addItems](#) for the menu shown on the left when a user clicks _Settings_.
* [Menu.Top.addItems](#) for the menu shown at the very top of each page.
* [Menu.Reporting.addItems](#) for the main menu shown on non-admin pages (the menu [just below the logo](#)) TODO: link to image here

Plugins can call the [MenuAbstract::add](#) method within event handlers for these events to add menu items. For example, the following will add a menu item titled **My Menu Item** to the admin menu that links to the **MyPlugin.myPage** controller method.

    // an event handler for Menu.Admin.addItems
    public function addAdminMenuItems()
    {
        MenuAdmin::add(
            "My Menu Category",
            "My Menu Item",
            array('module' => 'MyPlugin', 'action' => 'myPage'),
            $isVisible = true,
            $order = 10
        );
    }

**Invoking controller methods via AJAX**

TODO: where do we talk about adding JavaScript/LESS files? There may need to be another guide 'Working with Piwik's UI'
TODO: also need to talk about special elements on the page and how to create your own widgets and how to use Piwik's JS code
TODO: mention JS libs used, talk about ajaxHelper & uicontrol base object & require
If you have your own custom JavaScript running on Piwik, you can use AJAX to dynamically invoke controller methods and display the result. For example:

    // invoke MyPlugin.myPage and append the result to the end of the #root element
    var ajax = new ajaxHelper();
    ajax.addParams({
        module: 'MyPlugin',
        action: 'myPage'
    }, 'get');
    ajax.setCallback(function (response) {
        $('#root').append(response);
    });
    ajax.setFormat('html');
    ajax.send(false);

### Controller method conventions

**Getting query parameters**

Unlike API methods, controller methods do not take query parameters as input. If you need to access a query parameter value, use the [Common::getRequestVar](#) method.

**_To avoid XSS vulnerabilities, never access `$_GET`/`$_POST` directly, always go through [Common::getRequestVar](#)._**

**Generating Output**

As a plugin developer you are welcome to generate your output in any way you'd like (as long as it's secure), there is nothing in Piwik that will force you to code a certain way. That being said, most Piwik controller methods will have the following convention:

    public function myControllerAction()
    {
        // Step 1: if this controller action is supposed to execute some logic, do that first
        $idSite = Common::getRequestVar('idSite');
        $period = Common::getRequestVar('period');

        $somethingResult = MyDoer::doSomething($idSite, $period);

        // Step 2: create a view to render the output
        $view = new View("@MyPlugin/myControllerAction.twig");

        // Step 3: set properties of the view, getting data from APIs when necessary
        $view->somethingResult = $somethingResult;
        $view->neededData = API::getInstance()->getNeededData();

        // Step 4: render the view
        echo $view->render();
    }

**Calling API methods**

Since controller methods do not take query parameter values as method parameters it can sometimes be a pain to invoke API methods within controller methods. In this case, controllers make use of the [Piwik\API\Request](#) class which will forward all query parameters to an API method. For example, let's look at some of the code in the **save** method in the [Annotations](#) plugin controller:

    $view = new View('@Annotations/saveAnnotation');

    // NOTE: permissions checked in API method
    // save the annotation
    $view->annotation = Request::processRequest("Annotations.save");

    echo $view->render();

The code invokes the Annotations API's **save** method forwarding all query parameters so the controller method doesn't have to call [Common::getRequestVar](#) several times.

**Reusing controller methods**

Some controller methods (most notably those that output HTML for a report) will need to be reused in other controller methods. In such a case, `echo`-ing output instead of returning is not always desired. Existing Piwik plugins solve this problem by adding a `$fetch` parameter to the controller method to reuse.

For example:

    // the action we will reuse
    public function mySpecialReport($fetch = false)
    {
        $view = new View("@MyPlugin/mySpecialReport.twig");

        // ... set some $view properties ...

        if ($fetch) {
            return $view->render();
        } else {
            echo $view->render();
        }
    }

    // the action that mySpecialReport is reused in
    public function index()
    {
        $view = new View("@MyPlugin/index.twig");
        $view->mySpecialReport = $this->mySpecialReport($fetch = true);
        echo $view->render();
    }

Many existing plugins follow this convention. See, for example, the **UserSettings** controller.

### Controller Security

Like API methods, controller methods should make sure the current user is both valid and authorized to perform the requested action or view the requested data. This means calling the [access checking methods](#) that should also be called in API methods. It also means checking that the request method used is correct and that the supplied **token_auth** is valid (via [Controller::checkTokenInUrl](#)).

Here's an example of a secure controller method:

    public function myAdminTask()
    {
        Piwik::checkUserIsSuperUser();
        $this->checkTokenInUrl();

        if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] != "POST") {
            return;
        }

        // ... do some stuff ...
    }
